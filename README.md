# cycfx2prog-win32
Win32 port of cycfx2prog, Cypress EZ-USB FX2/FX2LP (CY7C68013) programmer.

Although initial port is done, I have abandoned this project and
switched to use fxload instead.

Please take a look at https://github.com/tai/fxload-win32 .
It is also ported to libusb-1.0 API, so can be used with the
WinUSB.sys driver attached to a device.
